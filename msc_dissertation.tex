% Executive summary
\section*{Executive summary}
This project aimed to design a system that would provide farmers with much more
accurate current weather information and forecast predictions for their specific
locality than is possible from general weather forecasts. It was an ambitious
project for the timescales involving the design and construction of four
hardware devices suitable for use in an agricultural setting in addition to the
development of backend and frontend software to capture the data from the
devices and provide an easy to use application for farmers to see the
information.  The system also included the development of machine learning
models which were trained using historic general weather data and the data
collected from the hardware devices.  The models were deployed to try and
provide more accurate localised forecasting.
\begin{itemize}
  \item I designed weather proofed, solar powered hardware devices which used
        low powered long range radio transmitters for data transmission.  Sensor
        nodes were equipped with temperature, humidity, wind speed and soil
        sensors and the system included a repeater node which doubled the
        effective range of the system. I also designed a gateway device which
        operated inside a WiFi enabled building to transmit the sensor data to
        the cloud
  \item I used a variety of language to develop backend software which received
        and processed the data from the gateway
  \item I developed a web app which displayed data to the end user and did a
        usability assessment of this app
  \item	I captured historical data from an online weather API to train machine
        learning models and deployed these models to provide local weather
        forecasts
  \item I reviewed studies where machine learning has been applied to the
        problem of forecasting for microclimates
  \item I compared the features and costs of my system to those of existing
        commercial systems
\end{itemize}
