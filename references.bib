  abstract = {Abstract Brief introduction: What are microclimates and why are they important? Microclimate science has developed into a global discipline. Microclimate science is increasingly used to understand and mitigate climate and biodiversity shifts. Here, we provide an overview of the current status of microclimate ecology and biogeography in terrestrial ecosystems, and where this field is heading next. Microclimate investigations in ecology and biogeography We highlight the latest research on interactions between microclimates and organisms, including how microclimates influence individuals, and through them populations, communities and entire ecosystems and their processes. We also briefly discuss recent research on how organisms shape microclimates from the tropics to the poles. Microclimate applications in ecosystem management Microclimates are also important in ecosystem management under climate change. We showcase new research in microclimate management with examples from biodiversity conservation, forestry and urban ecology. We discuss the importance of microrefugia in conservation and how to promote microclimate heterogeneity. Methods for microclimate science We showcase the recent advances in data acquisition, such as novel field sensors and remote sensing methods. We discuss microclimate modelling, mapping and data processing, including accessibility of modelling tools, advantages of mechanistic and statistical modelling and solutions for computational challenges that have pushed the state-of-the-art of the field. What's next? We identify major knowledge gaps that need to be filled for further advancing microclimate investigations, applications and methods. These gaps include spatiotemporal scaling of microclimate data, mismatches between macroclimate and microclimate in predicting responses of organisms to climate change, and the need for more evidence on the outcomes of microclimate management.},

  abstract  = {Most ecological studies of the effects of climate on species are based on average conditions above ground level (measured by meteorological stations) averaged across 100km2 or larger areas. However, most terrestrial organisms experience conditions in a much smaller area at the ground surface or within vegetation canopies, the climate of which can be very different to large-scale averages. Therefore, to accurately characterise the climatic conditions suitable for species, it is essential to include microclimate information. Microclimates are affected by the shape of the landscape, including the steepness and aspect of slopes, height above sea level, proximity to the sea or inland water, and whether a site is in a valley or at the top of a hill. Plants also modify the conditions found within or below their canopies, with the structure of vegetation playing an important role. The recent increase in the availability of microsensors and remotely sensed data at appropriate resolutions has led some ecologists to begin to include microclimate information within a variety of contexts; however the field can be confusing and intimidating and mistakes are often made along the way. In this chapter, we provide an overview of microclimatic processes and summarise the available methods of measuring and modelling microclimate data for incorporation in ecological research. We highlight pitfalls to avoid emerging novel methods and the limitations of some techniques. We also consider future research directions and opportunities within this emerging field.}

  abstract = {Urban open space provides various benefits to citizens, but the thermal environment of this space is impacted by global warming and urban heat islands. A growing number of studies have been conducted on strategies for improving the urban thermal environment and attracting more people to outdoor spaces. This paper reviews the mechanisms and cooling effects of four major mitigation strategies, namely, changing the urban geometry, planting vegetation, using cool surface, and incorporating bodies of water. Our review found that on summer days these four strategies yielded a median reduction in air temperature of 2.1 K, 2.0 K, 1.9 K, and 1.8 K, respectively. In terms of integrated effect on thermal comfort, changing the urban geometry provided the greatest improvement, with the largest reduction in physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) in summer (median ΔPET = 18.0 K). The use of vegetation and water bodies reduced the median PET by 13.0 K and 4.6 K, respectively. However, some simulation studies found that reflective surface led to higher PET in summer because of the increased amount of reflected solar radiation. The mitigation strategies improved the urban thermal environment to a greater extent in hotter and drier climates. Vegetation, cool surface, and water bodies provided less cooling in compact urban spaces than in open areas. The results that we reviewed can be used by designers and planners seeking to create thermally comfortable urban open spaces.}

  abstract = {The mechanisms by which a porous windbreak modifies airflow, microclimates and hence crop yields are addressed, based upon recent wind tunnel experiments, field observations and numerical modelling. This paper is thus an update to the excellent reviews in Brandle (1988). It shows how a turbulent mixing layer initiated at the top of the windbreak dominates the airflow behind a windbreak. This mixing layer spreads vertically as it moves downwind, growing at a rate determined by the turbulence in the approach flow and the windbreak's `permeability'. The roughness of the terrain and land-cover upwind, windbreak height and porosity are thus the main controls on the amount and extent of shelter provided by a windbreak. The changes in temperature, humidity, heat and evaporation fluxes given these changes in turbulence are then described. Based on the turbulent mixing layer model, the highly sheltered `quiet zone' will be typically warmer and more humid while further downwind in the `wake zone', cooler and drier conditions would be expected. The careful experimental studies needed to verify these theoretical predictions have not yet been published. Shade is also shown to modify the heating in the quiet zone and, depending on the orientation of the windbreak, can offset the warming in the quiet zone. Lastly, the mechanisms affecting plant productivity are described in light of these airflow and microclimate changes. A major effect of a windbreak is to reduce the incidence of low frequency, high magnitude damage events such as sandblasting or lodging. Microclimate effects, however, do not always improve productivity. For example, while shelter may improve water-use efficiency in irrigated crops by increasing yields and reducing water-use, this may not be the case in dryland agriculture.},
