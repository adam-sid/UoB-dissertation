\section{Introduction}

In this report, I describe an online tool called \myReportTitle{}, which
collects and displays microclimate data from an apple orchard via an IoT weather
sensor network that I designed and built. The tool aims to enable microclimate
specific forecasting and provide farmers with accessible, location specific
climate data to support decision making and enable microclimate specific
forecasting. The IoT hardware was built using off-the-shelf components and
housed in hand made enclosures. The deployed system consisted of four
components: two field sensor nodes capable of reading weather data and
transmitting it using a modern radio protocol called LoRa; a repeater that
boosts received LoRa signals; and an internet connected gateway that uploads the
weather data to an online database. The sensor nodes were placed at two
locations on the farm that the owner identified as having distinct microclimatic
conditions. This allowed for the collection of weather data tailored to specific
areas of interest, which was then displayed on the Agriscanner web application.


\subsection{Aims and contributions}

The main aim of this project was to develop a low-cost, low-maintenance IoT
solution that helps farmers monitor microclimate conditions and make better
informed decisions. The final hardware system needed to be physically robust to
survive outside while the the software needed to present relevant information in
an intuitive way, ensuring that users can easily make use of the data.

Weather is of critical importance to farmers, as it is an important factor in
final yield and helps to predict the optimal time to harvest, the likelihood of
disease growth and irrigation needs. However, weather forecasts are typically
based on data from distant weather stations and large scale models which fail to
capture variations that exist within a single farm. These local variations,
known as microclimates, can differ significantly even across relatively short
distances due to differences in elevation, tree cover, or soil conditions.

The key contributions of this paper are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The development of a low cost, ultra long-range remote weather station
    system with superior range and value to current solutions on the market.
    \item A publicly available web application that visualises live data from
    multiple field locations.
    \item A method for enabling microclimate forecasting by comparing local
    sensor data with broader regional weather forecasts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Layout of dissertation}

This dissertation has four parts. Part 1 provides the technical background to
understand the project, including an overview of the core technologies used and
a review of related work in the field. Part 2 details the hardware development
process, covering the rationale behind component selection, the testing of
hardware, and how the IoT nodes were deployed in the field. Part 3 focuses on
the software aspect of the project, outlining the design and implementation of
both the backend infrastructure and the frontend web interface. Part 4 then
offers a critical evaluation of the system, discussing its performance,
usability, and limitations, as well as highlighting opportunities for future
development improvements and research.
