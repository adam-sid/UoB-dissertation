\subsection{Microclimate prediction using machine learning}

There have been a number of recent studies where machine learning has been used
to help predict micro climate conditions. A 2021 study by Kumar et al developed
a machine learning framework that is able to predict a variety of climatic
variables such as soil moisture, wind speed and temperature. They were able to
get up to 90\% accuracy with a 12-120 hour forecast range.
