\section{Microclimates}

This section gives academic background on microclimates with a focus on their
relevance to agriculture, and then looks at related attempts to predict
microclimate weather.

\subsection{What is a microclimate?}

A microclimate is generally understood as a set of distinct climatic conditions
within a small, localised area \cite{MetOffice2023}. The maximum size of a
microclimate is debated, but the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) regards
it as occupying an area of anywhere from less than one metre across to several
hundred metres \cite{wmo2024}.  In practice, microclimates can occur in spaces
such as gardens, valleys, caves, or fields. Even human-made structures can
generate their own microclimates; for example, tall buildings can create
\emph{street valleys} that reduce wind flow and lead to the formation of
localised pockets of warmer air, which also trap higher concentrations of
pollution from vehicle emissions \cite{yang2023}. Vegetation plays a critical
role in influencing microclimates. The addition of trees to an urban environment
can reduce air temperature by as much as \SI{2.8}{\degreeCelsius}
\cite{lai2019}.

\subsection{Microclimates in agriculture}

Microclimatic variations have profound implications for agriculture, as the
climate that crops are exposed to has an enormous impact on overall agricultural
yields. Indeed, farmers have modified the microclimate of crop fields for
millennia, a clear example of this being the use of fencing to reduce soil
erosion and damage to edible plants \cite{cleugh1998}. Therefore, the
relationship between microclimates and agriculture has been the subject of
extensive research, particularly as climate change introduces new threats to
food security.

A Danish study by Haider et al. investigated how agricultural pests and diseases
are influenced by microclimatic conditions. Temperature sensors were installed
in six different pathogen habitats (such as hedges and cattle fields). The data
revealed that the daytime temperature in these microenvironments was
significantly higher than those predicted by Danish weather forecasts. Using
these measurements, the researchers then estimated the incubation periods of
various pests and diseases, demonstrating that elevated temperatures in
microclimates could shorten incubation times and thus accelerate the risk of
outbreaks \cite{haider2017}.

Another important aspect of microclimates for farmers is how it can affect frost
risk - sudden and unpredictable drops below freezing in crop fields that damages
plants and are particularly common in spring. A principal factor for this is a
lack of "cold-air drainage". In areas with depressed topography, cold, dense air
can accumulate to form pockets of cold air where temperatures can be several
degrees lower than the surrounding landscape \cite{drepper2022}. These local
conditions may not be captured by weather forecasts highlighting the need for
more precise monitoring and development of effective early warning systems.

\subsection{Microclimate prediction using machine learning}

There have been a number of recent studies where machine learning has been used
to help predict micro climate conditions. A 2021 study by Kumar et al developed
a machine learning framework that is able to predict a variety of climatic
variables such as soil moisture, wind speed and temperature. They were able to
get up to 90\% accuracy with a 12-120 hour forecast range.
