\subsection{What is IoT?}

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the concept of integrating networking
capability in a range of devices, allowing for cooperation to reach common goals
\cite{atzori2010}. To this end, IoT is a very broad idea and there has been
rapid ongoing growth of IoT in both domestic and business settings.

IoT often involves the integration of wireless networking into objects which
traditionally would not have had any such capability. For example the use of
smart lightbulbs, with the ability to control their status, brightness or colour
via a smartphone application.
