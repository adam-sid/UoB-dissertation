\section{Introduction}

In this report I give details of an online tool called \myReportTitle{}, an
interactive website that collects real time data from \farmName{} in
\farmLocation{}. The tool aims to give farmers accessible, specific climate data
to help reveal the existence of microclimates over a small area and inform their
decision making.

Three sensor clusters were distributed at three points in the farm. Each
cluster was powered by an ESP32 microcontroller and then a variety of sensors
were added to these. Data is then sent in real time back to a backend server
which processes the information and allowed for real time data to be presented
to farm workers via a website.
