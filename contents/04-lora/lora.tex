LoRa stands for \textbf{Lo}ng \textbf{Ra}nge and it is a relatively modern radio
modulation technique that allows for the transmission of data over much longer
distances than other comparable methods. In comparison to WiFi for example LoRa
has 4000 times the range (REFERENCE), with a theoretical maximum of
800km.

\subsection{How LoRa works}

The preamble of a LoRa packet sends the same symbol multiple times in a row to
allow the receiver to synchronise.

The most technically impressive aspect of LoRa is that it a receiver can
demodulate signals below the noise floor. The noise floor is the sum of all
unwanted signals in an environment. To use an example a stadium full of people
talking will create a certain level of background noise, in order to speak to
someone else in the stadium you would have to speak at a volume which can
overcome this background noise. The fact that LoRa receivers can successfully
demodulate below the noise floor is akin to being able to whisper in such a
stadium and still be understood.
