\section{Introduction}

In this report, I give details of an online tool called \myReportTitle{} which
was deployed alongside an IoT weather sensor network that I built myself. The
tool aims to provide farmers with accessible, specific climate data to support
real-time decision-making.

The IoT hardware deployed consisted of four separate custom built components:
two field nodes capable of reading weather data and transmitting this using
LoRa; a repeater that boosts received LoRa signals; and an internet-connected
gateway that uploads weather data to an online database. 

The nodes were placed at two different locations on the farm that the owner had
identified as having distinct climate characteristics (see section on
microclimates), meaning wider-area weather forecasts were unrepresentative.
