\section{Interview excerpt with Small Brook Farms
owners}\label{sec:small-brook-interview}

Interviewer: So you would need a weather station to observe very local weather,
I expect. What you're saying is that the BBC website weather is not necessarily
relevant to you?

Speaker 1: No, No , so there's another site which is in Sanford and we can have
conversations - we're what? - 5 miles apart 10 miles? 

Speaker 2: Yeah. So the other side of that hill there like a mile away you get a
different sort of weather, but even on this side of the [apple orchard] as
opposed to that side of the [apple orchard] like the wind can be less than
whatever else, its very localised. But you know you if you then go on that side
of the valley, it doesn't rain on this side. So like to be actually useful,
yeah, [weather monitoring] sort of has to be [based on] the farm.

\section{Battery cost assumptions}\label{app:battery-assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Agriscanner Network:} Replace 5 (2 per sensor node, 1 for
  repeater) Li-ion batteries every 3 years at a cost of \pounds{}20
  \(\Rightarrow\) \(\approx\)\,\pounds{}7 per annum.
  \item \textbf{SenseCAP S2120:} Three AA batteries per node, replaced twice a
  year (total 12 batteries) \(\approx\)\,\pounds{}10 per annum.
  \item \textbf{Decentlab Eleven Parameter:} Two C batteries per node, replaced
  four times per year (total 16 batteries) \(\approx\)\,\pounds{}30 per annum.
  \item \textbf{HOBO weather station kit:} Replace lead-acid for each node
  battery every 4 years at a cost of \pounds{}80 \(\Rightarrow\)
  \(\approx\)\,\pounds{}20 per annum.

        Both the Mann Whitney U and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were selected for
        this data because the SUS score is derived from Likert items. Likert

\section{How LoRa works}\label{app:lora-explained}

As this paper is not a technical study of radio communication I will opt for a
brief summary of the principles behind LoRa. With this in mind I have based much
of the information from the excellent video lecture in \cite{visualelectric2021}
that itself draws upon the paper in \cite{vangelista2017}.

The reason LoRa modulation is different to traditional modulation techniques is
the use of a "chirp" as the key to transmitting packets. A more traditional
technique might involve a frequency shift key; that is a single frequency
represents several bits. These unique frequencies are called symbols as they
represent data, like letters in the alphabet. In the below graph we see three
simplified symbols that represent binary values, the combination of these
symbols makes a packet:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  % left image
  \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{contents/part-1/fig1/frequencysymbols.png}
    \\[4pt]
    {\small (a) Frequency shift symbols} \end{minipage}\hfill
  % right image
  \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{contents/part-1/fig1/packet.png}
    \\[4pt]
    {\small (b) Packet}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{ Traditional radio modulation with frequency symbols}
  \label{fig:freq-and-packet}
\end{figure}

In traditional modulation, symbols always have flat unchanging frequency (as can
be seen from the fact the wave separation never changes). LoRa symbols instead
have changing frequencies that have a waveform like the below.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{contents/part-1/fig1/lorawavelength.png}
    \caption{LoRa symbol showing changing frequency ("Up-chirp")}
    \label{fig:lora-wave}
\end{figure}

This change in frequency is what gives the wave form the name "chirp". If
traditional frequency symbols were thought of a sound they would be similar to
morse code beeps while LoRa would be more similar to siren or \textit{chirp}ing
bird. LoRa has both rising and falling chirps (up-chirps and down-chirps).

Different LoRa symbols are then distinguished by the point in time of a
discontinuity. LoRa symbols are always delivered over a known length of time, so
different symbols include a reset back to the starting frequency at a different
point in time.

A way to graphically show this discontinuity in LoRa and compare it to frequency
shift modulation is by using instantaneous frequency graphs:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  % left image
  \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{contents/part-1/fig1/traditional-wavechart.png}
    \\[4pt]
    {\small (a) Frequency shift symbols} \end{minipage}\hfill
  % right image
  \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{contents/part-1/fig1/lora-wavechart.png}
    \\[4pt]
    {\small (b) LoRa symbols, note shifting discontinuity}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{ Comparison of frequency shift and LoRa modulation }
  \label{fig:freq-vs-lora}
\end{figure}

Once these symbols hit the receiver, the receiver must work out which symbol it
was. In frequency shift modulation this is achieved by performing a correlation
test against every symbol received. However this is computationally difficult
and requires a low signal-to-noise ratio to work effectively. The benefit of
chirps is that due to a mathematical transformation that will not be further
discussed (Fast Fourier transform), the correlation can be computed much more
easily and with less powerful hardware.


\section{IoT enabling technologies} \label{app:enabling-tech}

This supplementary section lists the key technological developments that have
are contributed to the viability of my project.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Efficiency improvements in microchips - breakthroughs in microchip
  fabrication have led to smaller more efficient chips with improved
  performance.
  \item Lithium-Ion batteries improvements - continuous improvements in the
  energy density of lithium-ion batteries has made it possible to power devices
  for long periods without mains power.
  \item Low-power long-range radio - new radio communication techniques such as
  LoRa allow for data transmission over several kilometres using a fraction of
  the power required by traditional mobile or Wi-Fi technologies.
  \item Affordability of solar panels - since 1970 the price of solar panels has
  decreased to 1/500th of its original cost \cite{economist2024} making solar a
  viable power source for IoT systems.
  \item Growth of hobbyist embedded systems - since the release of accessible
  platforms such as Arduino in 2005, the growth of hobby level embedded systems
  has lowered the barrier to entry to create IoT systems.
  \item Accessible cloud computing and hosting - Cheap and available web hosting
  has allowed application level systems to be more easily developed.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Alternative model data}

The below figure was used to produce the alternative model by applying these
adjustments to the general OpenWeather forecast.
