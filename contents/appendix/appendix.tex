\section{Interview excerpt with Small Brook Farms
owners}\label{sec:small-brook-interview}

Interviewer: So you would need a weather station to observe very local weather,
I expect. What you're saying is that the BBC website weather is not necessarily
relevant to you?

Speaker 1: No, No , so there's another site which is in Sanford and we can have
conversations - we're what? - 5 miles apart 10 miles? 

Speaker 2: Yeah. So the other side of that hill there like a mile away you get a
different sort of weather, but even on this side of the [apple orchard] as
opposed to that side of the [apple orchard] like the wind can be less than
whatever else, its very localised. But you know you if you then go on that side
of the valley, it doesn't rain on this side. So like to be actually useful,
yeah, [weather monitoring] sort of has to be [based on] the farm.

\section{Battery cost assumptions}\label{app:battery-assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Agriscanner Network:} Replace 5 (2 per sensor node, 1 for
  repeater) Li-ion batteries every 3 years at a cost of \pounds{}20
  \(\Rightarrow\) \(\approx\)\,\pounds{}7 per annum.
  \item \textbf{SenseCAP S2120:} Three AA batteries per node, replaced twice a
  year (total 12 batteries) \(\approx\)\,\pounds{}10 per annum.
  \item \textbf{Decentlab Eleven Parameter:} Two C batteries per node, replaced
  four times per year (total 16 batteries) \(\approx\)\,\pounds{}30 per annum.
  \item \textbf{HOBO weather station kit:} Replace lead-acid for each node
  battery every 4 years at a cost of \pounds{}80 \(\Rightarrow\)
  \(\approx\)\,\pounds{}20 per annum.

List of tasks for users:

\begin{enumerate}\label{list-of-tasks}
  \item To the nearest degree, what was Node 2's temperature at 14:00 18 August
  2025?
  \item To the nearest 1\,m/s, what was Node 1's gust speed at 13:00 26 August
  2025?
  \item Go to wind speed and change the graph to compare mode. What colour is
  Node 2 gusts represented by?
  \item What is the forecast for humidity at 06:00 tomorrow for Node 1?

        Both the Mann Whitney U and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were selected for
        this data because the SUS score is derived from Likert items. Likert
        items are ordinal (e.g. strongly disagree) and so nonparametric
        statistical testing is typically preferred
        \cite{bobbitt_mann-whitney_2022}\vspace{8pt}

    The Mann Whitney U statistical test score was calculated in an Excel sheet I
    made using the procedure described in \cite{bobbitt_mann-whitney_2022} and
    the result cross-verified using the website in \cite{socscistats} which is
    also the source of the p-value. Results: U = 13.5, critical value = 10
    p=0.10524. Parameters: two-tailed, 0.05 significance\vspace{8pt}
    
    Due to the complexity of calculating it, the one-sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank
    Test score was calculated in Excel using a modified template from the source
    in \cite{peterstatistics_wilcoxon_2025} and cross-verified with the website
    in \cite{statsBlue}. Results: \(W^{+}=119\) z = 3.3361, critical value =
    1.6449 Parameters: right-tailed, 0.05 significance \end{minipage} } }
